# Shadow dodger

ShadowDodger is a maze game, where you incarne an IA, that is missioned by The Compagny to control little robots to gather some Scraps.
Your conscience start when the robot startup, after being landed on a planet. Your goal : Gather all the scraps without letting your batteries drains to 0.
The Compagny, give you 3 robot per planet. But beaware that draining a robot, leave it's body in place. So don't get stuck.

## Current Beta :

**Mission 1 :** Radium gathering on AT-6H3.
**Gameplay mode :** Easy (When the player die, the body does not stay in place).

Good luck :)
